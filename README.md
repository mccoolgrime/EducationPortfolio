Most files are related to a workflow that demonstrate analysis of a single unit assessment (with fictionalized grades modelled after similar class distributions).<br><br>
WORKFLOW:
1) Excel - creation of data structure, data entry, data cleaning, data transformation
2) SAS - EDA in SAS Studio: SAS workbook shows code (most of it generated), html and pdf are two different forms of the same generated report
3) Tableau - Data Visualization/Storytelling of in-depth analysis via dashboard. Workbook uploaded here. [Dashboard posted on Tableau Public.](https://public.tableau.com/views/SampleClassroomAssessment/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

For in-depth information about the creation and scoring of assessments, see the powerpoint presentation.
